<h1 id="assignment-2">Assignment 2</h1>

<h2 id="literature-review">Literature Review</h2>
<p>Before we begin to conduct research about a topic we need to know, at minimum, two things:</p>

<ol>
  <li>What have others written, reported, or discovered about this topic?</li>
  <li>What are the gaps in the existing literature that need to be filled by new research?</li>
</ol>

<p>To answer these questions we need to examine, thoroughly, the research that has been previously published about our topic. That is, we need to do a <strong>literature review</strong>.  There are a variety of strategies for finding, and analyzing literature for the purpose of a research review (e.g. a systematic review, a strategically sampled review, etc.) We will talk about each of these approaches in Week 3 of class.</p>

<p>For your second assignment you will conduct a literature review about your topic using a generalists approach. You will identify 10-15 examples of peer-reviewed literature and then write up a narrative which synthesizes the findings of this literature. The literature review will help clarify your knowledge of the topic you are research, and motivate your own new research project by identifying relevant new questions to ask.</p>

<h2 id="step-1-literature-review-draft">Step 1: Literature Review Draft</h2>

<p>The first step in this assignment requires you to identify literature, and synthesize the findings of this literature in a short narrative. If you are working in a group you need to find at least 15 peer-reviewed articles (individually you will need to find 7)</p>

<p>To identify literature you should conduct keyword and topic searches against databases that are available from the UW library (as well as tools like Google Scholar).</p>

<p>You should only read the abstracts of papers to identify whether or not they are relevant to your research project.</p>

<p>When you have identified the set of literature that will be used for your review you should then write a narrative the summarizes this work. For example you might include information about:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The main findings of a study</li>
  <li>The setting of the study, and why this is relevant to your research topic</li>
  <li>Any limitations of these studies (individually or as a whole)</li>
  <li>What knowledge gaps or research opportunities have been identified by reviewing this literature</li>
</ul>

<p>The Literature Review draft is due October 30th. The draft should be approximately 2 pages single spaced (1100 words not including citations). Please cite all work using APA format.</p>

<p>Tips on writing a strong literature review:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Be sure to include 1-2 sentences at the beginning of your literature review which explains the topic that is being reviewed.</li>
  <li>I strongly recommend that you restrict your search to literature published within the last 5-8 years.</li>
  <li>A good literature review does not just list a study and say what its findings are - A good literature review will use previously studies to build an argument about why new research is needed</li>
</ul>

<p>** Note: After you have turned in the literature review draft you should revisit Assignment 1. You will now be able to update and improve your first draft of Assignment 1 (in particular your research questions), and prepare a final submission.</p>

<h2 id="step-2-peer-review">Step 2: Peer Review</h2>

<p>We will exchange drafts of the literature review for feedback from peers. Each group (or individual) is only responsible for doing one peer review.</p>

<p>The feedback of a peer review will consist of the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Clarity: How well did the authors explain their research topic, and provide a meaningful argument based on the findings of previous research studies?</li>
  <li>Gaps: Have the authors identified convincing gaps in the literature that suggest additional research is needed?</li>
  <li>Additional literature: Based on your own very quick search of this topic in a single database recommend one additional resource that the authors should read for their review.</li>
</ul>

<p>The peer review exchange is meant to update you on your colleagues work, and provide an opportunity to learn from one another based on the structure and arguments that are made in the first draft of the literature review assignment. If you like how your colleagues have organized their ideas, or how they structured their review - feel free to borrow from their example (note this is what all good researchers do- They borrow STRUCTURALLY from each other often!)</p>

<p>Complete your peer review as a written document that answers the questions above (100-300 words). You should provide this to a group you are reviewing NO LATER THAN November 6th.</p>

<h2 id="step-3-literature-review-final-draft">Step 3: Literature Review Final Draft</h2>

<p>To complete this assignment you should update your first draft based on feedback from your instructors and peers. In particular you should aim to better align the problem statement (Assignment 1) and your literature review. This means that, for example, when you are asking a set of research questions, you explain through a review of the literature why these research questions are valuable and worthy of being answered.</p>

<p>A final draft of the literature review is due December 4th, 2020. You may turn in a final draft at any time before this date. The final draft should be approximately 3 pages single spaced (1650 words) citations not included. You must cite all literature that you consulted using APA.</p>
